# frc-gearbox

This project serves as an example of an all-in-one gearbox that can be used for FRC Robots. It includes a pulley system, Falcon 500 motors, a simple frame, and detailed sketches that can be examples for other teams to implement in their robots. I was learning along the way, but I'm happy with the result and will now move toward subsystem design.
